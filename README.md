# Butler-George
The interface to the overwhelming power of the Discord bot API!

# Why another bot?
The bot was initially only intended as a gimmick for my server, but has now developed into a huge tool for administration and moderation. We use the bot for sorting roles, embedding and thus beautifying messages and much more.
Other functions are also planned, which we will then address in the release notes. A separate wiki is planned to come with the second version of the bot!
Due to the range of commands that this bot now covers, we decided to publish the bot and thus theoretically offer it to anyone who understands how to start Java programs and register a bot on the Discord Developer Portal themselves.

# What's our goal?
Our long-term goal is to be able to remove all bots that are up to mischief on our server and to be able to do everything without them. This should give us independence, individuality and security when it comes to failures, etc. We know from experience that a bot that is not in our hands and on whose development we have no influence is too unreliable due to possible failures and problems.
Otherwise, it should of course also provide us with the wide range of possibilities that Discord provides bots.

# Who can participate?
Pretty much anyone who understands Java and can put up with reading through the JDA Documentation. Of course he should also be a member of the Discord server (https://www.discord.gg/6FBK9d2dDZ) and be reliable and trustworthy!
Once accepted, you also get a purple "Developer" role and access to any development channels on the server. If you are interested, just get in touch on the Discord server!

# How do we work?
The whole repository is built like a Maven project. It doesn't really matter which editor you use for this, but I work with Eclipse and if we want to be able to help each other with problems, it would make more sense that we all work with one editor. However, if you don't care about that, I won't stand in your way if you want to use a different one.
Otherwise we communicate via a separate channel on the NoLimits Discord Server and otherwise organize ourselves completely via it. Also, with the #ðŸ‘½-dev-logs channel, we can follow what's happening with the repository here!
