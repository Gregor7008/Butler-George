### üìó History
In Juli 2021 [Nevar](https://nevar.eu) by [@1887Jonas](https://discordapp.com/users/631176108372656148), the bot we used since the creation of our community was shutdown. And as auto role assignment was really important for the security of the server back then, we needed to find a replacement real quick. And as there was also a need for automated actions resulting from this autorole mess, we decided to start our own bot: **Butler George** was born!<br>
On the [29th of August 2021](https://github.com/Gregor7008/Butler-George/commit/bca680096ab6ee534a6621c9ed565e940733ca57) **Butler George** was finally ready to completey replace all previously used functions of Nevar. Since then he was developed into a huge tool for administration, moderation and server configuration, implementing all commonly used functions on big servers: Join2Create channels, level and experience system, ModMail, reaction roles and much more.
